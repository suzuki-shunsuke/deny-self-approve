# :warning: Commit isn't linked to a GitHub User

If deny-self-approve failed due to the error `Commit isn't linked to a GitHub User`,
it means the pull request includes commits not linked to a GitHub User.

In GitHub, each commit is linked to a GitHub User by email address.
But if email address isn't set, a commit isn't linked to a GitHub User.
For details, please see the document.

https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/troubleshooting-commits/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user

deny-self-approve gets a pull request's committers to validate self-approvals.
But if a commit isn't linked to a GitHub User, deny-self-approve can't validate properly.
In that case, deny-self-approve fails.

## How To Solve the error

1. [Please configure email properly according to the document](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)

```sh
git config [--global] user.email <your email address>
```

2. There are two options:

- Recreate a pull request
- Rebase commits and edit commits' email. Note that this modifies commit histories

If you're not familiar with Git, you should copy code and recreate a pull request.

If you don't want to recreate a pull request, you need to edit commit histories.
We don't describe the detail here, but we note some hints:

```sh
git rebase -i HEAD~N # Change the command to `edit`
git commit --amend -C HEAD --author <your email address>
```
